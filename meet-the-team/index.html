            <div class="physio-profile-text">
                <p>I qualified as a Chartered Physiotherapist in 2014 from the University of Birmingham.</p>
                <p>I love all aspects being a physiotherapist has to offer, and my particular passion is paediatrics and elderly rehabilitation. I have gained experience working in many NHS physiotherapy specialities and quickly realised that working with children in paediatrics, adult and elderly rehab were my particular passion.</p>
                <p>I love seeing clients of all ages improve and being able to be a part of their journey to health and recovery, whether that be in their own home, nursing home, school or community setting.</p>
                <p>In my spare time I like to walk my dog and take my baby swimming or to the park.</p>

                <p>I qualified as a Chartered Physiotherapist in 2016 from Kings College London.</p>
                <p>After I qualified I moved back home to the Midlands where I have gained lots of experience working as a physio in both hospital and community settings. I have over 8 years of experience working with children and young adults in multiple specialties including neurology, oncology, musculoskeletal, rheumatology, orthopaedics and rehabilitation. It brings me so much joy helping young people to achieve their goals and reach their optimal potential. It’s a real privilege to be able to be part of my clients rehab journeys.</p>
                <p>In my spare time I like to be outside running, cycling or hiking in beautiful places. I love training for ultra marathons and seeing what the human body is capable of. </p>

                <p>I qualified as a Chartered Physiotherapist in 2021 from the University of Coventry.</p>
                <p>I love working as a physiotherapist and have gained a wide range of experience during my time rotating in the NHS. I enjoy seeing people achieve their goals and have a better quality of life. I also work for the NHS on Elderly and Medical wards, so have a good understanding of community services available to also help with rehabilitation and support.</p>
