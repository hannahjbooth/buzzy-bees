            <p>BSc Hons, MCSP, HCPC</p>

            <h4>Buzzy Bees Director and Chartered Physiotherapist</h4>

            <p>I qualified as a Physiotherapist in 2014 from the University of Birmingham.</p>
            <p>I love all aspects being a physiotherapist has to offer, and my particular passion is paediatrics and elderly rehabilitation. I have gained experience working in many NHS physiotherapy specialities and quickly realised that working with children in paediatrics, adult and elderly rehab were my particular passion.</p>
            <p>I love seeing clients of all ages improve and being able to be a part of their journey to health and recovery, whether that be in their own home, nursing home, school or community setting.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I like to walk my dog and take my baby swimming or to the park.</p>
