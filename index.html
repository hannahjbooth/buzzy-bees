                <p class="text">Really insightful and helpful appointment where we got to the bottom of multiple underlying issues from playing sport. Claire explained why I may still be feeling pain and gave me a thorough plan including exercises with reps and sets to help my recovery. Overall: Lovely experience, would recommend.</p>
